# The Summary of My Life Story

My name is Benjam√≠n Haverla, and I live in Martin, Slovakia. I studied Information and Digital Technologies at [Private Secondary Technical School](https://ssosta.edupage.org) in Poprad, founded by the Tatra Academy n. o. Currently, I am studying at the [University of Creative Communication](https://www.vskk.cz/cz/) in Prague. I specialize in the Design Motion Copy department, which focuses on Animation and VFX.

My way to filmmaking was strange. When I was young I played a lot of computer games. Later at the age of 12, I suffered from epilepsy and I had to stop playing computer games. I lost something that I loved. But after a bad period of my life, my mum brought the first iPad 4 to our family. I was curious and I found there the app iMovie. iMovie was my first video editing software. So this is the point where my film career started. At the age of 12. I asked my friends to cooperate and we created a lot of film series, however as we were little they were not that professional. Later, thanks to my teacher I became successful in film competitions for youth and children in Slovakia. As an actor, I cooperated on advertising for an ISIC company in Slovakia.

In 2020, word about me and my work reached some people, leading me to create videos for clients. Over time, I created my first international short film, blending live-action and animated elements. Garnering awards and nominations, I chose to step into the background actor role, gaining insights into larger-scale film productions. Subsequently, I became an Animation/Film instructor for a kids' camp, held annually for one week. Currently, I'm gaining valuable experience as an intern in Berlin through Erasmus+. During this period, I'm also preparing a new animated music video.
